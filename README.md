### Topic
ttH(->WW) event reconstruction using neutrino-weighting &amp; SPANet

-/ work in progress /-


---
### Information about this repository
data and output are not included in the git repository and must be added manually

input and output paths must be adapted to the system


---
### Current Tasks
- include mass information in the jet reconstruction algorithm (truth-to-reco matching)
- compare process effficiency of SPANet to classical Chi^2 algorithm (See 05.12.2023, tth(WW) Project Logistics)
